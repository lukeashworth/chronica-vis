To compensate for the lack of connections between kinships you need to:

crete a kinship with name of:

"KINSHIP"

create a character called

"KINSHIP STANDIN"

create a connection between the "kinship standin" character to the "KINSHIP"

then to create links between kinships:

Create a connection between the "kinkship standin" to another kinship.
